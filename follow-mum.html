    <h1>Entering House</h1>
    <p>As you enter your house, you heard some footsteps in your room. You carefully approach your room and see the back of a woman going through your stuff. You threaten to call the police on her.</p>
    <p>She slowly turn around and to your surprise, it's mum. She ran towards you and gave you a hug. Tears streaming down her cheeks. </p>
    <p>Mum: "Oh I miss you so much. But we need to leave here quickly. Before your dad finds us. I promise to explain everything but we got to go now."
    <button onclick="followMum()"> You and your mum hurriedly leave the house. </button>
