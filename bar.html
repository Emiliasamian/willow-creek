    <h1>Bar</h1>
    <p>You tried sneaking into the bar when suddenly you felt a hand on your shoulder. You turned around just to see a muscular guy dressed in all-black looking menacingly at you.</p>
    <p>Bouncer: "ID please."</p>
    <p>You realised that in your rush to follow your dad, you had left your wallet which contained your ID back home.</p>
    <p>Bouncer: "No ID, no entry."</p>
