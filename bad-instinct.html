    <h1>Following Your Instinct</h1>
    <p>You decided to trust the guy since he has the necklace and photo afterall. 
        He lead you to the bar where you had seen your father previously. 
        However, instead of going through the front door, he showed you the secret door that leads directly to the bar's basement.</p>

    <p> You noticed a woman being tied to a chair in the middle of the basement. You slowly approached her and soon realises that it is your mum.
        As you turned to ask for help from the guy, you felt a blow to your head and passed out. </p>
