    <h1>Eavesdropping</h1>
    <p>Aunt: "The child turns 18 today. Should we be prepared to tell her the truth?"</p>
    <p>Grandmother: "No. We need to wait on the leader's decision. We must not be impulsive. She is very much like her mother, and that very reasoning might put us in danger."</p>
    <p>You wonder if the child they were talking about was you. If so, who is this leader that they were talking about. And how or why would you put them in danger.</p>
