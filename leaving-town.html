    <h1>Leaving Town</h1>
    <p>You and your mum manage to leave the town undetected. She explained how everyone and everything in the town was a lie. The family members that you knew weren't actually blood related.
    They were all part of the cult that had taken root in your town, led by none other than your own father. Your mum further explained how she had escaped the clutches of the cult, fleeing to safety and having to leave everything behind, including you. And now she has risked everything again to get you out from your father's trenches. </p>
