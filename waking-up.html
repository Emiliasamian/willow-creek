    <h1>Waking Up</h1>
    <p>You slowly come to senses and open your eyes. You are tied to a chair and your mum is nowhere to be seen.
        You see a silhoutte emerging from the shadow. It's your dad. He is dressed in some kind of weird robe. 
        You can hear chanting in the distance. The voices seem familiar but you can't tell. You head still hurt after being strucked.</p>

    <p>Dad: "I'm sorry my precious child. We can't have you snooping around. I need you to behave.</p>

    <p> He then gestured into the distance. The chanting gets louder. 
        You see your grandparents, aunt, and some townfolks, all dressed in the same robe as your dad. The guy from earlier emerges from the shadow as well.
    He brings over a bowl of reddish liquid and forced it down your throat. As you slowly fades into slumber, you hear your dad whispering in your ear that everything will go back to normal.</p>
