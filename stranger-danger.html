    <p>Guy: "Shhh... He's gonna see you.</p>
    <p>In shocked, you just waited till your dad has passed before pulling the guy's hand away from your mouth.</p>
    <p>Guy: "I'm so sorry. But I couldn't risk us getting caught."</p>
    <p>You looked at his in confusion. He pulled out a necklace from his pocket alongside a photo of you as a toddler with your mum. The necklace seems to be the same necklace as the one your mum is wearing in the photo. </p>
    <p>Guy: "Your mum gave this to me to proof to you that she's alive. She had asked me to come for you and bring you to her."
