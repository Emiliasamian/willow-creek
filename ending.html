    <h1>Ending</h1>
    <p>As you stand there listening to your mum's explanation, you can't help to wonder what is the truth. Should you go back to town to hear your dad's explanation or believe in this crazy tale from your mum whom you have not seen in 6 years.
        The decision weighs heavily on your shoulders as you stand at the precipice of destiny, the future stretching out before you like a vast, uncharted wilderness. But deep down, you know that there can be no turning back. 
        Whatever path you choose, the die has been cast. </p>
