    <h1>Calling The Police</h1>
    <p>You called the police to inform them about the break-in and within 5 minutes, a police car was at your doorstep. They told you to wait outside as they entered the premises.
        You heard some scuffling in the house. The front door swung open and out came a woman, rushing straight towards you. She grabbed on to you and you soon realises that it was your supposedly deceased mum.</p>
    <p>Mum: "Everything is a lie. TRUST NO ONE." </p>
    <p>The police officers rushed after her and pinned her to the ground. You yelled at them to stop as it was your mother but they ignored you. As you tried to pull them away from her, you felt a blow to your head and passed out. </p>
